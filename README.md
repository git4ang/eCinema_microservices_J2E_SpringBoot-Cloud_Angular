# eCinema Microservice (fullStack Project): Java EE & Angular 11

***
***
Project developed in **Java EE** with **Spring 5 framework** (+ Spring Boot & Spring Cloud) and frontend (Angular 11, bootstrap 4).

- The goal of this project is to implement a Java EE web application on the backend side and Angular 7 on the frontend side for managing the Cinema entity.
  This project concerns the implementation of JPA-2, JUnit-Mockito, Hibernate 6, Spring 5 (MVC, IOC, Spring security, Spring boot, Spring cloud ... etc),
  microservices (config-server, eureka-server, gateway-server, open feign, loadbalancer, Hateoas, actuator...etc), JWT, MySQL Database, H2 Database, GIT, Maven, docker,
  Angular 11, Boostrap 4â€¦ etc.

### The creation of the project is based on the following points that will be detailed below:
   - [x] Project initial (multiProject)
   ***
   - [ ] M01-config-server module creation.
     - Spring Cloud Config provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system.
       With the Config Server, you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments.
   ***
   - [ ] M02-config-eureka module creation.
     - Eureka Server is an application that holds the information about all client-service applications.
       Every Micro service will register into the Eureka server and Eureka server knows all the client applications running on each port and IP address.
   ***  
   - [ ] M03-config-gateway module creation.
     - An API Gateway is a server that is the single entry point into the system. All requests from clients first go through the API Gateway.
       It then routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
   ***  
   - [ ] M10-microservice-city module creation.
     - Set up the M10-city-microservice module with the creation of the necessary packages such as: entities, repositories, restControllers, services, exceptions, proxies ... etc
   ***
   - [ ] M11-microservice-cinema module creation.
